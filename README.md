## Overview

### The challenge

Understanding customer sentiments about products is of utmost priority for any product company including HP. Consumers are more vocal on social media platforms and express their feedback and experience about any product. HP too needs to know consumer sentiments first-hand so that it can make better products with great user experience and resolve customer issue faster. 
HP needs a one stop knowledge store, which can store reviews, suggestions, complaint and sentiments for all HP consumer printers/PC/laptop. This will help HP understand the consumers better and improve brand value and NPS score.
